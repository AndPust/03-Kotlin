# 03-Kotlin
A small frontend bot written in Kotlin that communicates with Discord. You can ask it for all items in the shop, categories of items in the shop and items in the given category, using keywords "items", "categories" and "in" respectively. The bot is not approved in Discord and thus can only see the messages directed specifically to it, so pleas use `@ShopBot` in the Discord chat.

To run the application run the gradle script in the main directoey:

`./gradlew run`
